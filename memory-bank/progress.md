[2025-05-15 05:09:53] - ## FCM Token Logging Progress (Timestamp: 2025-05-15 01:09 AM UTC-4)

**Goal:** Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token logging in the console upon user login.

**Steps Taken:**
1.  **Initial State:** FCM was configured in `app.config.ts`, but the `onMessage` handler in `ChatService` (which logs foreground messages) was not being triggered, and no FCM token was being logged.
2.  **Problem 1 Identified:** The `requestNotificationsPermissions()` method in `ChatService` was not being called after login.
    *   **Solution:** Modified `ChatService.login()` to call `this.requestNotificationsPermissions()` after successful login and navigation.
3.  **Problem 2 Identified (via console error):** `getToken()` in `ChatService.saveMessagingDeviceToken()` was failing with a "Failed to register a ServiceWorker" error.
    *   **Cause:** The `firebase-messaging-sw.js` file was missing from the project.
    *   **Solution:** Created `src/firebase-messaging-sw.js` with the correct Firebase project configuration (obtained from `src/firebase-config.js`) and basic message handling logic.

**Current Status:**
*   The `login()` method now attempts to request notification permissions.
*   The `firebase-messaging-sw.js` file has been created.
*   The user will now test locally by running `ng serve` to confirm that the FCM device token is logged to the console after login and permission grant.

**Next Steps (Pending User Confirmation):**
*   Verify successful token logging in the local development environment.
*   User to commit changes (modified `chat.service.ts` and new `firebase-messaging-sw.js`) to GitHub for cloud deployment.

[2025-05-15 05:25:25] - ## FCM Token Logging - Successful (Timestamp: 2025-05-15 01:25 AM UTC-4)

**Previous Goal:** Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token logging in the console upon user login.

**Resolution Steps for Local Development (`ng serve`):
1.  **Problem:** `firebase-messaging-sw.js` was not being served by `ng serve`, resulting in a 404 error and `getToken()` failure.
2.  **Cause:** The `src/firebase-messaging-sw.js` file was not listed in the `assets` array in `angular.json`.
3.  **Solution:** Modified `angular.json` to include `"src/firebase-messaging-sw.js"` in the `projects.friendlychat.architect.build.options.assets` array.

**Outcome:**
*   User ran `ng serve` locally.
*   Upon login and granting notification permissions, the browser console successfully logged:
    *   `Requesting notifications permission...`
    *   `Notification permission granted.`
    *   `Got FCM device token: [TOKEN_VALUE]` (actual token was displayed).
*   The 404 error for `firebase-messaging-sw.js` was resolved for local development.

**Next Steps for Cloud Deployment:**
*   User to commit the modified `angular.json` and the new `src/firebase-messaging-sw.js` to GitHub.
*   This will ensure the Firebase cloud build includes the service worker correctly, resolving the issue for the deployed application as well.
